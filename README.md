## ParkinsonDiseaseClassification

# **Overview**
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques to improve the early and accurate diagnosis of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease (PD), a progressive neurological disorder affecting over 10 million individuals globally. By combining cutting-edge ensemble models and innovative data preprocessing techniques, the system achieves diagnostic accuracy comparable to professional clinicians, with the potential to enhance medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings.

Key features include a robust machine learning pipeline for model training and optimization, ensemble learning for high accuracy, and descriptive analysis to identify the most critical attributes influencing PD diagnosis. This project showcases the integration of engineering and data science in healthcare applications, paving the way for innovative medical solutions.

# **Features**
- Machine Learning Models: Trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Decision Trees.
- Ensemble Learning: Developed a weighted voting classifier that combines Random Forest and Gradient Boosting to achieve 91% accuracy.
- Feature Engineering: Designed impactful features, such as MotorFunctionScore and Cholesterol_Ratio, to enhance model performance.
- Data Preprocessing: Applied techniques like MinMaxScaler for scaling, SMOTEENN for balancing class disparities, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Descriptive Analysis: Identified and ranked key predictors of PD, such as motor function impairments and cholesterol ratios, to support future research.

# **Key Metrics**
- Accuracy: 91%
- Precision: 89.71%
- Recall: 80.26%
- F1-Score: 84.72%
- ROC-AUC Score: 96.88%

# **Results**
The ensemble model demonstrated robust performance with an accuracy of 91% and an ROC-AUC score of 96.88%. Descriptive analysis identified motor impairments as the most significant predictors of PD, followed by cognitive and functional scores. These insights contribute to a better understanding of PD diagnosis and can guide future research and clinical applications.
